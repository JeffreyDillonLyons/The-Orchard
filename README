Hello boys,
Welsome to our Github respository. 
We can use this to manage and merge succesive version of the code. 
When separately working on a relatively complicated project, each of us making small improvements to small parts, it is very useful to have all of the succesive version saved and accessible.
In the end we can submit this repository as our deliverable. Igor will like that a lot.
